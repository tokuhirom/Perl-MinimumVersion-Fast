# NAME

Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast - Find a minimum required version of perl for Perl code

# SYNOPSIS

    use Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast;

    my $p = Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast->new($filename);
    print $p->minimum_version, "\n";

# DESCRIPTION

"Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast" takes Perl source code and calculates the minimum
version of perl required to be able to run it. Because it is based on goccy's [Compiler::Lexer](https://metacpan.org/module/Compiler::Lexer),
it can do this without having to actually load the code.

Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast is an alternative fast & lightweight implementation of [Perl::MinimumVersion](https://metacpan.org/module/Perl::MinimumVersion).

This module supports only Perl 5.8.1+.
If you want to support __Perl 5.6__, use [Perl::MinimumVersion](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::MinimumVersion) instead.

In 2013, you don't need to support Perl 5.6 in most of case.

# METHODS

- my $p = Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast->new($filename);
- my $p = Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast->new(\\$src);

    Create new instance. You can create object from `$filename` and `\$src` in string.

- $p->minimum\_version();

    Get a minimum perl version the code required.

- $p->minimum\_explicit\_version()

    The `minimum_explicit_version` method checks through Perl code for the
    use of explicit version dependencies such as.

        use 5.006;
        require 5.005_03;

    Although there is almost always only one of these in a file, if more than
    one are found, the highest version dependency will be returned.

    Returns a [version](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?version) object, `undef` if no dependencies could be found.

- $p->minimum\_syntax\_version()

    The `minimum_syntax_version` method will explicitly test only the
    Document's syntax to determine it's minimum version, to the extent
    that this is possible.

    Returns a [version](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?version) object, `undef` if no dependencies could be found.

- version\_markers

    This method returns a list of pairs in the form:

        ($version, \@markers)

    Each pair represents all the markers that could be found indicating that the
    version was the minimum needed version.  `@markers` is an array of strings.
    Currently, these strings are not as clear as they might be, but this may be
    changed in the future.  In other words: don't rely on them as specific
    identifiers.

# BENCHMARK

Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast is faster than Perl::MinimumVersion.
Because Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast uses [Compiler::Lexer](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Compiler::Lexer), that is a Perl5 lexer implemented in C++.
And Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast omits some features implemented in Perl::MinimumVersion.

But, but, [Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast) is really fast.

                                Rate Perl::MinimumVersion Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast

    Perl::MinimumVersion::Fast  182/s                3365%                         --
